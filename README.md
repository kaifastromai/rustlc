# Rustlc
A hilariously simple rust line-counter program. That's all it does. 
#### Why, though...?
Because I write rust code, and want to get an idea of how much a project is developed, and also the other 
solutions using  bash/zsh/unix utilites are very finicky, at least for me.

#### You could trivially extend this to be more general, why only Rust?
I'm a lazy SOB.
